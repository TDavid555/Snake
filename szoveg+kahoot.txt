2. Our goal was to modernize the Snake game. We created a web-based version

3. To build the game, we used HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for the website structure, JavaScript for game mechanics, and SVG for rendering the playing field

4. The main page includes a short history of Snake, a description of how to play, and a button to start the game

5. When you start the game, there is a loading screen, and then you see a menu. You can choose a difficulty level before playing

6. Players can create an account and log in. This allows them to save their progress and appear on the leaderboard

7. We have a page for editing account details, such as username

8. We have a leaderboard that shows the top 10 players. This makes the game more competitive

9. To organize our work, we used Trello for project management and Figma for designing the website.
